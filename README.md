# Email-Spammer
a simple python CLI tool to spam emails

how to use -

start the program and then login to your gmail (its totally safe, its linked to google servers)

if you get *Bad Credentials* error then you have to enable *Less Secure Apps* in your gmail account so that you can login to the smtplib server using python.
